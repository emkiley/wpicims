<h1>About CIMS</h1>

<p>
The problems facing business and industry are growing ever more complex. Often, the solution of these highly technical problems involves sophisticated mathematics that may tax a company's internal resources. The Center for Industrial Mathematics and Statistics was created as a mathematical resource to industry. The faculty <a href="members.html">members</a> and students associated with the Center have the expertise to address today's complex problems.
</p>

<p>
Faculty and students associated with CIMS have worked with local companies on more than thirty projects at the graduate and undergraduate level.
</p>

<p>
In addition to developing projects and industrial contacts for WPI students and faculty, CIMS has taken a leadership role by organizing various activities for the benefit of the applied/industrial mathematics community. A few examples are:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>The Mathematical Problems in Industry workshop, 2003, 2005, 2008.</li>
	<li>The Mathematics in Industry Summer Institute for High School Teachers, June 2002 - 2004.
	<li>The Mathematics in Industry Workshop for High School Teachers, June 2000.
	<li>The NSF Sponsored Research Experience for the Undergraduates in Industrial Mathematics and Statistics Summer Program, 1998-2009
	<li>The Northeast Regional SIAM Mathematics Industry Workshop, May 1998
</ol>
