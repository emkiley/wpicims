<h2>Motivations</h2>
<p>Despite overwhelming technological progress, many microwave processes/systems are still developed on the basis of <i>extensive experimentation</i>. This usually requires utilization of substantial resources and makes <i>an unavoidable impact on the cost</i> of the final products.</p>
<p>Practical techniques of mathematical modeling and optimization</i> may be of enormous help in improving this situation, but, overall, they remain poorly involved in routine use in the industrial environment.</p>

<h2>Strategic Goals</h2>
<p>The Group works towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>moving communications between microwave industries and modeling-specialized academic institutions on a higher level, and</li>
<li>making modeling more usable to reduce the cost of production and improve equipment characteristics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Operations</h2>
<p>The Group:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>helps industry realize the benefits</i> of suitable/applicable computational opportunities,</li>
<li>encourages microwave businesses to <i>formulate their demands on corresponding CAD tools</i>, and</li>
<li>assists in <i>creative/inventive use of available modeling/optimization tools</i> in applied R&D and practical design.</li>
</ul>
