<h2>Excursion to Swiss Light Source (SLS) Synchrotron Facility</h2>
<br />

<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>Prior to the sessions on Monday, March 7, the seminar participants will have the opportunity to visit the premises of Swiss Light Source (SLS) of the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland.</p>

<p>This excursion is made possible by generous support from our seminar sponsors - <a href="http://www.gigatherm.ch">Gigatherm AG</a>, <a href="http://www.qwed.com.pl">QWED</a>, and <a href="http://www.sairem.com">SAIREM SAS</a>.</p>

<p>The trip is scheduled as follows:</p>

<h3>Facility Overview</h3>
<p>A detailed presentation of specific beamlines relevant to the field of time-resolved characterization of materials using synchrotron radiation diffraction or imaging techniques (including those used in-situ) is planned at SLS.</p>
<p>Performing microwave heating experiments (e.g. real-time X-ray diffraction, micro-tomography) at synchrotron radiation facilities enables the detailed, in-situ observation of structural phase transitions, sintering, wetting, thermal expansion and grain growth processes in various materials. Computational efforts devoted to the coupled thermomechanical modeling of microwave radiation effects on organic, inorganic and biomaterials can thus benefit from the sound experimental basis that this technique provides.</p>

<h3>Clearance</h3>
<p>SLS requires the names of the visitors to their facilities to be available one week ahead of the tour. Therefore, only those seminar participants who registered for the trip not later than on February 28, 2011 will be permitted to enter the SLS premises.</p>
