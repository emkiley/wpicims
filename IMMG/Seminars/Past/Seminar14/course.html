<h2>Short Course in Multiphysics Modeling</h2>
<br />
<p>In association with the Seminar, the Chair of Materials Processing of the University of Bayreuth organizes a graduate-level short course covering topics in multiphysics computer modeling in microwave power engineering and materials science.</p>

<h3>Date:</h3>
<p>Wednesday, March 7, 2012</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom:8px">9:00 to 12:00 Optimization in Materials Science: Open Your Minds</h3>
	
<p><strong>Professor Michael Gasik<br />
School of Chemical Technology<br />
Aalto University, Finland</strong></p>
<p>The course answers the questions: what is practical optimization in materials science? what is meta-analysis and how to apply it in materials design and processing. MODAO principles are introduced and discussed. Outline of meta-modeling (RSM) and multivariate analysis (SOM, clustering) is also given. Considered example of application to materials design include demonstrations with mode Frontier MathCAD integration.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom:8px">13:00 to 19:00: Introduction to Multiphysics Modeling in Microwave Power Engineering</h3>

<p><strong>Professor Vadim V. Yakovlev<br />
Department of Mathematical Sciences<br />
Worcester Polytechnic Institute, MA, USA</strong></p>
<p>The course reviews issues and challenges in the development of processes and systems of microwave thermal processing of materials and shows how these difficulties could be
addressed (as well as what problems could be resolved) with the use of computer modeling. Scientific and technical aspects of microwave heating and related physical phenomena are discussed
in the context of their mathematical characterization; corresponding numerical techniques are briefly reviewed. Options provided by modern computer tools for multiphysics simulation are
considered. Computational strategies of modeling systems and processes in microwave processing are discussed and illustrated by examples of successful modeling projects. A hands-on component
of the course allows the students to exercise with <i>QuickWave-3D</i>, the modeling software  with advanced capabilities in simulation of electromagnetic and thermal phenomena in diverse
microwave heating scenarios. Course format: 4 hours of lectures (including Q&A), 2 hours of hands-on computer exercises.</p>
<br />

<h3>Who Should Attend:</h3>
<p>Graduate students in materials science, physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, etc. with research interests in microwave thermal processing; engineers/practitioners involved in development of systems and processes of microwave heating.</p>
