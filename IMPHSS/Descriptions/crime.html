<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>
	One of the great and nagging questions of all time is:  How safe is the place where I 
	live?  Families spend small fortunes on security systems for their home and take extra 
	precautions when on vacation all so they can feel safe.  By examining the crime statistics 
	for the fifty states across seven different categories, students can get a feel for where 
	the safe places in the United States are, and where the least safe places are as well.</p>

<h2>Areas of Application</h2>

<p>Basic Statistics including:</p>
	<ul>
	    	<li>Box & whisker plots</li>
	    	<li>Mean, median, quartiles, standard deviation</li>
	    	<li>Histograms</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Background Information</h2>

<p>
	The Bureau of Justice Statistics is a unit of the U.S. Department of Justice whose principal function
	is the compilation and analysis of data and the dissemination of information for statistical purposes.  Its
	mission is to "collect, analyze, publish, and disseminate information on crime, criminal offenders, victims
	of crime, and the operation of justice systems at all levels of government.  These data are critical to
	Federal, State, and local policymakers in combating crime and ensuring that justice is both efficient
	and evenhanded."</p>
<p>
	Among the statistics kept by the Bureau of Justice Statistics are the number of incidents of violent
	crimes (murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) and the
	number of property crimes (burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft).  These incidents are 
	maintained for every year and every state beginning in 1960 and are available online at 
	<a href="http://bjsdata.ojp.usdoj.gov/dataonline/Search/Crime/Crime.cfm" target="_blank">BJS Crime Trends</a>.</p>
