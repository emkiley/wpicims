<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>
						The premium that an auto insurance company charges for a policy is dependent on many factors
						including driving record, number of years of driving experience, age, whether the driver is
						the principal operator of the vehicle, and whether the driver has had driver training.  These
						factors are encoded in the Safe Driver Insurance Plan (SDIP) step and the rate class assigned
						to a driver on a policy.  The task in this project is to investigate real data from an insurance
						company to discover the relationships between the driver demographics and the premiums.</p>

<h2>Areas of Application</h2>
						<ul type="disc">
					    	<li>Percentages</li>
					    	<li>Graphing & scatterplots</li>

					    	<li>Data Analysis & statistics</li>
					    	<li>Line of best fit & correlation coefficient</li>
					    	<li>Exponential Growth & Decay</li>
					    </ul>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
						<ul type="disc">
					    	<li>SDIP Levels (also called 'steps') are a rating of a driver's performance.  The lower the SDIP number, the safer the driver.</li>
					    	<li>All new Massachusetts drivers are assigned to SDIP 15.</li>
					    	<li>Premium costs increase or decrease depending on SDIP rating.</li>
					    	<li>A driver's rate class, which is determined by factors such as age and years of driving experience, also affects premiums.</li>
						</ul>

<h2>Materials Included</h2>
						<ul type="disc">
							<li>Background information about SDIP steps and rate class codes</li>
							<li>Student worksheets (<i>Worksheets.doc</i>) introducing the project.</li>
					    	<li>Data table of SDIP levels, number of policies at each level, number of policies that 
					    		reported losses, and total monetary losses incurred at each SDIP level and rate class.  
					    		See the spreadsheet <i>"You're in the Driver's Seat.xls"</i></li>
					    	<li>Six separate project questions, each with student exercises, explanations, and sample solutions.</li>
					    	<li>A spreadsheet (<i>Surcharge Points.xls</i>) to automatically calculate premiums according to the <i>new</i> SDIP system</li>
					    	<li>Correlation coefficient tutorial</li>
					    </ul>
