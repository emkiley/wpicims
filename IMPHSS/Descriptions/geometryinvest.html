<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>When choosing between investment opportunities, each has its own expected return and risk.  Generally,
the greater return you wish to receive, the more risk you have to take.  You have a sum of money that you 
would like to invest, and you are trying to decide between two investments.  What is the percentage of 
your money that should be invested in each to maximize return and minimize risk?  Using mathematical formulas
and interactive Geometer's Sketchpad tools, your goal is to develop an efficient portfolio mathematically.</p>

<h2>Areas of Application</h2>
					<ul type="disc">
					<li>Elementary probability and statistics</li>
				    	<li>Algebra and geometry</li>
				    	<li>Basic graphing on a Cartesian Coordinate system</li>
				    	<li>Understanding and using <i>Geometer's Sketchpad</i></li>
					</ul>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
					<p>
						When comparing between two securities in which an investor could put his/her money, there are two 
						concerns an investor will have: risk of the investment and the possible return.  Graphing this in 
						the 1st quadrant of the coordinate plane could look like this:</p>
						<img src="../Images/riskreturn2.gif" class=center width="400" height="400" border="0" alt="risk-return graph">
					<p>
						Obviously, the best place for an investment to be is in the top left quadrant of this graph.  It 
						represents the greatest return with the least amount of risk.</p>
