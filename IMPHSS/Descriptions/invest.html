<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>
						One of the primary responsibilities of financial advisors is to help their clientele 
						in developing a stock portfolio in which the returns are maximized and risk is 
						minimized.  You will be gathering historical data about stock prices and constructing
						portfolios based on the companies you choose.  You will then develop an algorithm 
						that will provide good estimates for stock return and use these estimates to 
						build an optimal portfolio.</p>

<h2>Areas of Application</h2>
					<ul type="disc">
						<li>Elementary probability and statistics</li>
						<li>Algebra</li>
						<li>Geometer’s Sketchpad</li>
						<li>Understanding and use of Excel</li>
					</ul>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
					<p>
						Harold M. Markowitz developed the subject known as Modern Portfolio Theory in the 
						1950’s.  Markowitz built an objective function that combines maximum return and minimum 
						risk.  He defined risk as standard deviation in return and defined as efficient a portfolio 
						that maximized return for a given level of risk.  One of the reasons that this type of 
						information is important to stock brokerage houses is that they can use this 
						information to assist in purchasing.</p>
					<p>	
						This project makes extensive use of Excel, as there are many data points that must be 
						analyzed on a large scale.  While Excel has the ability to calculate Means, Covariance, 
						Correlation, and Standard Deviation easily, it is good to understand the process that 
						goes into these calculations.  For an introduction to Excel, see the 
						<a href="../Tutorials/Excel Tutorial.doc">Excel tutorial.</a></p>
