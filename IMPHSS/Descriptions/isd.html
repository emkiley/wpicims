<h2>The Problem</h2>

					<p>
						When 10 gallons of gasoline are pumped into your gas tank, 10 gallons of gasoline vapor are 
						displaced.  To prevent the vapor from escaping into the atmosphere, gasoline pumps are equipped 
						with Enhanced Vapor Recovery Systems (EVR systems), which recover the displaced vapor.  The gasoline 
						pump is also equipped with an In-Station Diagnostic System (ISD system), which monitors the EVR 
						to make sure that it is working properly.  If the EVR fails, the ISD system responds by shutting 
						down the pump.</p>
					<p>
						When a company develops an ISD system, it must be tested and certified before it can be put on the 
						market.  The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has set regulations that require an ISD system to 
						catch at least 95% of all failures in order to become certified.  The purpose of this project is to 
						design statistical certification tests that CARB can run on new ISD systems to efficiently test 
						their accuracy.  CARB tests ISD systems by instituting artificial failures at the pump.  The failure 
						in the EVR should cause the ISD to shut down the pump.  CARB runs a certain number of trials, and the 
						accuracy of the system is determined from the number of failures that the system catches versus the 
						number it misses.  The certification test procedure must include how many trials to perform, how 
						many failures must be caught in order to pass a system, and how stringent the test can be before 
						it begins to cause error in the certification procedure.</p>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
					<p>
						Veeder-Root, Inc. of Simsbury, Connecticut is a leading manufacturer of In-Station Diagnostic 
						Systems. In order to sell its diagnostic systems in the state of California, Veeder-Root must 
						demonstrate that their products comply with the regulations of the California Air Resources 
						Board (CARB).  Veeder-Root and CARB must agree on certification tests that demonstrate 
						compliance.  Working together, engineers, statisticians, and technicians at Veeder-Root and at 
						the California Air Resources Board are involved in developing and performing these certification 
						tests.</p>
					<p>
						The California Air Resources Board (CARB) defines the performance levels for diagnostic systems 
						in gasoline stations.  If the vapor recovery system is not working properly, then the alarm system 
						should shut down the pump.  CARB requires that the alarm system catch at least 95% of all true failures 
						with no more than 1% false alarms.</p>
					<p>
						Many companies face the challenge of demonstrating that their products satisfy some type of quality 
						or reliability or safety criteria.  As this example illustrates, in these situations there is not 
						one right answer but a trade-off between two competing objectives of maximizing safety while controlling 
						costs.  The primary tools needed to make decisions regarding quality and safety on the one hand, and the 
						costs involved on the other, include basic probability statistics, including the Binomial theorem. In 
						addition, because this kind of problem is very subtle but arises in virtually every arena of public 
						policy – where it often has to be argued with words rather than numbers – communication skills are 
						especially important.  This task requires the ability to conduct research, give and follow 
						directions, summarize technical text, and – in its presentation to the regulatory board – make 
						effective arguments and develop ideas systematically.</p>
					<p>
						There are two types of error to consider in this problem:</p>
					<ul type=disc>
						<li>Fail a system that is actually good</li>
						<li>Pass a system that is actually bad</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The same dichotomy applies to every medical test (e.g. mammograms) that can fail in two ways:  miss real 
						problems or falsely flag problems that do not exist.  The first is of real concern to the patient, 
						the second to the health care system as a whole.</p>
					<p>
						Veeder-Root is most concerned about limiting the chances of the first type of error. CARB is most 
						concerned about limiting the chances of the second type.  The Veeder-Root engineers argue that a 
						sequence of 3 tests is sufficient.  The statisticians at CARB argue that this test is not sufficient 
						to support the company’s claim of 95% accuracy. What would the statisticians have to show to 
						prove their point?  What is the probability that a bad system, one working at only 80% accuracy, would 
						pass this test?</p>
