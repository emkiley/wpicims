<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
	The PrasMic Corporation is a manufacturer of metal parts for automobiles and 
	machine tools. At the end of their production line are four machines that hone 
	the parts, that is they refine existing holes to a precise diameter in the 
	parts. PrasMic is concerned about their honing capacity. Occasionally the 
	weekly demand is greater than their weekly honing capacity, a shortage occurs, 
	and the customer’s demands are not met. The company does not run at maximum 
	capacity the entire time because having honed product in inventory costs money. 
	They prefer to hone and ship as necessary. However, to buy a new machine costs 
	approximately $4 million and take 18 months to order and install.</p>
<p>
	Complicating the situation is the company’s record keeping. PrasMic receives 
	release forms from its various customers which contain the customer’s order for 
	the week and their predicted order for the next nine weeks. Because PrasMic 
	prefer to hone on demand, they have always only considered the current demand 
	when planning their production and very rarely kept the release forms to look 
	at the predicted demand for the coming weeks. As a result, the data set is 
	incomplete and only contains information from the release forms the company 
	happened to keep. Regardless, PrasMic needs the existing data analyzed and a 
	recommendation given for how to deal with their capacity shortages.</p>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
		Data is provided for three of the four companies for which PrasMic manufactures 
		parts:</li>
	<ul type="circle">
		<li >
			Fiord and Costly are automobile manufactures.</li>
		<li >
			Walabe is a machine parts manufacturer.</li>
		<li >
			Unskil is a machine tool manufacturer (no data available).</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		There are four machines:</li>
	<ul type="circle">
		<li >
			Two machines are dedicated to honing parts for Fiord and Costly.</li>
		<li >
			One machine, affectionately called "Bing Angus", hones parts for Walabe.</li>
		<li >
			One machine hones parts for Unskil (no data available).</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		PrasMic rarely has one hundred percent uptime:</li>
	<ul type="circle">
		<li >
			The Fiord and Costly machines average seventy percent uptime.</li>
		<li >
			Big Angus and the Unskil machine average eighty percent uptime.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		PrasMic currently has two production schedule depending on demand</li>
	<ul type="circle">
		<li >
			Their regular work schedule is five days with approximately twenty-one machine 
			hours per day.</li>
		<li >
			Their overtime work schedule is six days with approximately twenty-one machine 
			hours for the first five days and fifteen overtime hours on the sixth day</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
