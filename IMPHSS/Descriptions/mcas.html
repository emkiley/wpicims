<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>
						Today schools have access to a myriad of data about their students from demographic information 
						to scores on standardized tests. Many schools are trying to incorporate students’ performance on 
						standardized tests into the course selection process. However, the problem is that schools have 
						<i>too</i> much data and are uncertain how exactly to analyze and incorporate it into their curriculum 
						programming. Compass High School, a large Massachusetts public school, is conducting an analysis 
						of the grade 10 Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) results using data from the 
						2002 and 2003 MCAS administrations. In addition, Compass High School has included the grade 7 
						Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT-7) Basic Battery scores in their analysis. The Basic Battery 
						was selected by Compass High School as one of the indicators to be used for grade 9 course 
						selections. The Basic Battery includes academic skills in Reading, Math and Language thought to be 
						important for academic success and MCAS performance. The school would like to use the data collected 
						from both tests to analyze their results and establish some guidelines for predicting future 
						performance based on previous information. The school has previously used the MAT-7 Basic Battery Score 
						as part of its grade 9 course enrollment process. It would like to assess how predictive the MAT-7 
						Basic Battery score is of future MCAS performance.</p>

<h2>Areas of Application</h2>
						<ul type="disc">

					    	<li>Statistics:  mean, median, standard deviation, interquartile range, box & whisker plots,
							histograms, hypothesis testing, t-Tests, blocking, simple random sample</li>
					    	<li>Regression analysis:  linear regression, lines of best fit, coefficient of
							determination (r<sup>2</sup>), residuals</li>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
					<p>
						In 1993, Massachusetts lawmakers passed a bill called the Education Reform Law.  It initiated
						a series of changes that completely altered education in Massachusetts.  The Education Reform
						Law set up requirements for accountability in individual students, schools and districts,
						reflecting on the state as a whole.  As a further step of education reform, the Massachusetts
						Comprehensive Assessmet System, or the MCAS, was implemented.  The test was required for all
						public school students in Massachusetts to measure performance basd on the Massachusetts Curriculum
						Frameworks learning standards.  It was designed to serve as one basis of accountability for students,
						school, and districts.  Starting with the class of 2003, all public school students would
						have to pass the Grade 10 MCAS in order to graduate.</p>

<h2>Materials Included</h2>
<p>Information about each project is provided in a Word file, which includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A project overview</li>
	<li>Background information</li>
	<li>Project Goals</li>
	<li>Student worksheets</li>
	<li>Extensions</li>

</ul>

<p>A second Word file contains suggested solutions for each project.</p>
	
<p>Two Excel files contain standardized test data for students who were in grade 10 during 2003.  
Individual student scores on the MAT-7 in Grade 7, the MCAS in Grade 8, and the MCAS in 
Grade 10 are provided.  Note that the data reflect actual student scores. Findings
based on your analyses will reflect real student performance.</p>
