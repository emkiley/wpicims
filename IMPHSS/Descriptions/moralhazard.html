<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>
	The First Step Insurance Agency is one of the largest car insurance agencies in Massachusetts.  The
	agency has hundreds of agents and hundreds of thousands of insurance policies.  In order to 
	stay profitable and competitive the agency must spend thousands of man hours not only investigating 
	suspicious claims, but also investigating its own agents. The insurance giant is concerned that some
	of its agents have not been investigating the claims assigned to them thoroughly enough, resulting 
	in overpayment to the policy holder and a loss for the company.  The company is also concerned 
	that some agents are simply inflating their claim payouts.  The company needs to investigate the 
	“moral hazard” of its agents.</p>
<p>					
	By examining the data representing a group of agents working for 
	First Stage Insurance Agency, is it possible to determine whether any single agent’s losses differ
	significantly enough from First Stage’s average to warrant further investigation of that agent?</p>

<h2>Areas of Application</h2>
						Basic statistics:
						<ul type="disc">
					    	<li>Box & whisker plots</li>

					    	<li>Mean, median, quartiles, and standard deviation</li>
					    	<li>Hypothesis test</li>
					    </ul>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
					<p>
						The size of the insurance industry indicates that people are eager to pay to avoid risk.  They pay
						and get nothing if fortune smiles on them, whereas if misfortune strikes, they break even because
						the insurance should just pay back the value lost in the misfortune.</p>
					<p>
						Sometimes, however, people do better than break even when misfortune strikes, and this possibility
						has greatly interested economists.  If, for example, the misfortune costs a person $1000, but
						insurance will pay $2000, the insured person has no incentive to avoid the misfortune and may act
						to bring it on.  This tendency of insurance to change behavior is called <strong><i>moral hazard.</i></strong></p>
					<p>
						Sometimes moral hazard is dramatic.  Fire insurance encourages arson, automobile insurance 
						encourages accidents, and disability insurance encourages dismemberment.  In a story in its December
						23, 1974 issue, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> reported this bizarre instance of moral hazard:</p>
					<p>

						<i>"There is a macabre case of "Nub City," a small Florida town that insurance investigators
						decline to identify by its real name because of continuing disputes over claims.  Over 50 people
						in the town have suffered 'accidents' involving the loss of various organs and appendages, and
						claims of up to $300,000 have been paid out by insurers.  Their investigators are positive the
						maimings are self-inflicted; many witnesses to the 'accidents' are prior claimants or relatives
						of the victims, and one investigator notes that 'somehow they always shoot off parts they seem
						to need least."</i></p>
					<p>
						Moral hazard does not require that people <i>intentionally</i> cause the misfortune.  If they
						simply take fewer measures to prevent the misfortune, the same outcome occurs.</p>

<h2>Materials Included</h2>

<p>A long version and a short version of this project are provided.  Both versions ask similar questions
about a data set from First State Insurance agents; however, the data set used in the long version is significantly
larger.  Computer software such as Microsoft Excel is therefore highly recommended for data analysis of the long 
version, whereas the short version may be completed either with computer software or by hand.</p>

<p>Both versions of the project contain the following information:</p>
						<ul type="disc">
					    	<li>A database which includes the loss in dollars per agent for agents working
							for First Stage Insurance Agency.</li>
							<li>Suggested student activities and solutions.</li>
							<li>Helpful student tutorials regarding:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Box and whisker plots</li>
									<li>Normal curves, and construction and interpretation of histograms</li>
									<li>Hypothesis testing with the z-statistic</li>
								</ul>
							<li>A standard normal probability table</li>
						</ul>
