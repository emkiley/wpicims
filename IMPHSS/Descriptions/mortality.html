<h2>The Problem</h2>
					<p>
						A “child rider” is a supplementary insurance added to an existing policy that provides 
						benefits for the children of the primary insured.  The primary benefit is a payment of 
						$1000 in case of the death of any one of the children regardless of the number of children, 
						genetic or adopted.  The current cost for a “child rider” is $6.00.  This price was 
						determined in 1953 and has not changed since then. Is this a good price for insurance?</p>
					<p>
						All children of the primary insured are covered by the child rider policy from age 14 days 
						to 21 years.  Infants from 0-14 days have the highest mortality rate and are therefore not 
						covered.  Is there still a need to not insure infants until after 14 days?  Could the age 
						restriction be changed from 14 days to 7 days?</p>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
					<p>
						The current cost for a “child rider” is $6.00 which provides a death benefit of $1000 until 
						21.  This price was obtained by an non-rigorous “back of the envelope” calculation that 
						assumed an average number of children per policy (2.3) and an average child mortality rate 
						(1/1000).  The result was a cost of $2.30 for a thousand dollars of coverage.  The company 
						added $3.00 for profit and expenses and then rounded up to obtain the $6.00 
						annual premium.</p> 
					<p>
						Ignoring the nonrigorous methodolgy of the insurance company, how much should the child rider
						cost to cover the expected claims when</p>
					<ul type="disc">
				      	<li>You don't know the number of children per family.</li>
				      	<li>You don't know the ages of the childred in the family.</li>
				      	<li>The price was originally computed using life tables from the 1950s.</li>
