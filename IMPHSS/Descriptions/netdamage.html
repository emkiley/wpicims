<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>
						Any large business or organization is a complex web of interconnected people and departments.  An 
						individual department functions at normal capacity when it receives resources and information that 
						it needs from other departments.  In turn, a department can provide resources and information to 
						other departments when it is functioning normally.  Therefore, the organization as a whole operates 
						normally only when each individual department is functioning at normal capacity.  What happens to 
						an organization when one or more of its departments cannot operate at full capacity?  How does this 
						lost capacity, or damage, affect the rest of the organization?</p>
					

<h2>Areas of Application</h2>
						<ul type="disc">
					    	<li>Modeling</li>
					    	<li>Matrix operations including multipication, addition, and transposes</li>

					    	<li>Graph theory</li>
					    </ul>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
					<p>

						When a company takes a quantitative risk analysis approach to disaster recovery planning, any number 
						of mathematical models can be utilized to analyze the company.  The model takes the organization as 
						a complex structure of interconnected departments.  The organization can implement this model in a 
						simulation that is designed to identify vulnerabilities in the structure.  The organization can use 
						the results of the simulation to develop effective strategies to eliminate or protect these weaknesses 
						in the system.  Some possible models include the standard network flow model and the decision analysis 
						model, which an organization can use to implement a quantitative approach to risk analysis.</p>
					<p>
						Network models are used to simulate flow through oil pipelines, shipment of goods between factories 
						and distribution points, telephone communications, and many other related activities.  The model 
						allows the user to look at the structure of the system in order to determine its flaws.</p>
