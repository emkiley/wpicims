<h2>The Problem</h2>

					<p>
						Morgan Construction Company in Worcester, Massachusetts designs and manufactures rod rolling mill 
						equipment for steel plants.  During the rolling process at the plant, each billet of hot steel
						increases in velocity to approximately 120 meters per second.  A rotating piece of equipment
						incorporating a curved pipe, called the <strong><i>Laying Pipe</i></strong>, is used to change the forward
						velocity of the steel rod into rotational velocity.  In essence, the laying pipe takes the straight
						rod and coils it into what resembles a super-heated slinky.  Due to friction, the laying pipe wears
						out and must be replaced periodicially, which requires the mill to shut down production.  The rolling
						mill operators want to maximize the life of the laying pipe, and therefore minimize costs.</p>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
					<p>
						The rod rolling mills start with billets of hot steel at 
						approximately 1000<span style='font-family:Symbol'>°</span>C, which are up to 180mm square in cross 
						section and up to 10 – 15 meters long.  The steel is put through a series of rollers that gradually 
						reduce the cross-section down to the desired product size, as small as 5mm in diameter.  During the 
						rolling process, the speed of the hot steel moving through the mill gradually increases to where it 
						is traveling at speeds up to 120 meters per second after the last rolling stage.  The rod comes out of the 
						laying pipe in the form of a continuous helix, which can be formed into a coil once cooled for 
						transport.  </p>
