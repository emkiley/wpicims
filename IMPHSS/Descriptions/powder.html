<h2>The Problem</h2>
					<p>
						In the manufacturing of the ceramic capacitors (a device capable of holding 
						an electric charge), the first step in the process is the mixing of the raw 
						materials to produce the ceramic powder to be utilized in the manufacturing 
						process.  This synthesized ceramic powder is then mixed with an organic binder 
						prior to being cast into greenware tapes for the manufacture of the 
						capacitors.  Adding organic binder is similar to adding water to cement mix in 
						order to be able to pour the cement.  In this case, the binder is mixed with the 
						powder and allows the powder to be cast into greenware tapes.  The greenware tapes, 
						after drying, have the consistency and thickness of a 5 ¼ inch floppy disk.  They 
						are then made conductive by coating with a metallic ink, stacked, and cut into 
						strips.  The strips are then processed through a series of ovens that first 
						slowly removes the organic binder and then sinters (bakes) the ceramic power 
						into a hard, solid strip of ceramic material.  These solid strips are later cut 
						into the individual capacitors.  The problem is to determine some of the parameters 
						for the powder manufacturing process.</p>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
					<p>
						The process involved in the manufacture of the ceramic powder is made up 
						of a series of steps and needs to be done in the most time effective manner. </p>
					<p>
						The ceramic powder is produced by the following process:</p>
					<ul type="disc">
							<li>Three different raw materials, X, Y and Z , are first combined as powders in 
							a large container in a ratio by weight of 10 : 3 : 1.</li>  
							<li>The 20 kilogram batches of the raw materials are mixed for a period of 4 hours.</li>
							<li>This 20 kilogram mixture is then heated in an oven at a temperature of 600° C 
							for a period of 8 hours to produce the ceramic powder, XYZ. </li>
							<li>The resulting material has consistency of chalk. Thirty (30) kilogram batches 
							are ground up into powder to obtain particles with a specific maximum size during 
							a 4 hour process. </li>
							<li>The particle size is determined by a screening process with about 85% of the 
							ground material being acceptable.  (The non-acceptable material can be used if it 
							 re-ground to the proper size.)  </li>

							<li>Organic binder is then added to the acceptable ground powder in a ratio of 8 : 1  
							by weight (powder to binder) and mixed for 8 hours to produce the powder-binder 
							mixture that is then cast into the greenware tapes for further processing.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The fabrication process for the greenware tapes requires 2.5 kilograms of ceramic powder 
						per finished block.  There are 1,000 blocks of greenware tapes produced every 24 
						hours.  The process engineer also wants to produce enough extra powder so that if a 
						problem occurs (oven or mixing unit breaks down, raw powder or organic binder shipment 
						is one day late), the process can continue to run for 24 hours without a stoppage.</p>
