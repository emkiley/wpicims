<h2>The Problem</h2>

					<p>
						A company which supplies parts and services has certain requirements from its customers, which include 
						low cost, reliable assemblies, and on-time delivery.  While all three factors are important to both 
						the supplier and the customer, the customer has identified delivery time as their primary concern 
						since they do not have the resources to handle the variation.  The supplier is late far too often, and 
						if the supplier ships the assemblies too early, it causes problems for the customer. As such,
						the company wishes to use a Six Sigma approach to reduce variability in delievery times.  
						Six Sigma is a term for various coroporate strategies used to lower variation and unpredictability in some aspect
						of a product.</p>
					
					<p>	
						The company held an internal meeting to improve their delivery process.  They defined a measurement, “Customer Delivery,” 
						which is the number of days between when a shipment is promised and when it is actually shipped.  
						The measurement is positive number if the shipment is late and is negative if the shipment is early.
						At the meeting, the company discussed what they can measure at their facility as a predictor of Customer Delivery.
						Students will mathematically identify which factors contribute to variation in Customer Delivery and produce a
						set of recommendations for the company to reduce that variation.</p>
					
	

<h2>Areas of Application</h2>

					    	<li>Regression</li>

					    	<li>Statistics - histogram, mean, standard deviation, correlation plot</li>
					    	<li>Excel</li>
					    	<li>Mini-Tab (optional instead of Excel)</li>
					    </ul>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
					<p>
						Since the supplier has decided that Customer Delivery has the highest priority in keeping 
						their customers satisfied, the supplier would like to explore the various factors that cause the 
						variability in Customer Delivery and determine mathematically which, if any, can be controlled.  The delivery 
						dates acceptable to the customer are in the time frame of 10 days early and 20 days late 95% of the time.</p>

						<strong><i><u>DMAIC</u></i></strong> - pronounced "Duh-May-Ick" - refers to a data-driven quality strategy for improving processes,
						and is an integral part of the company's Six Sigma Quality Initiative.  DMAIC is an acronym for five
						interconnected phases:  Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control</p>

<h2>Materials Included</h2>
		<p>
			There are two versions of this project, the first for algebra students and the second for statistics.
			Both are available for download below, along with the appropriate Excel files.</p>
			<ul type="disc">
		   		<li>DataFile.xls</li>
				<li>GageRR.xls</li>
				<li>MSAResults.xls</li>
				<li>ICD.xls</li>
			</ul>
<p>Additionally, an optional extension to the project delves more deeply into some of the decision-making
processes outlined in the main project.  The extension is appropriate for both the Algebra and Statistics versions.</p>
