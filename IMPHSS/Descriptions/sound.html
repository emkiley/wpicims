<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
	Countless technologies have been developed that use mathematical algorithms to 
	analyze sound inputs. Such devices include hearing aids, microphones, speech 
	recognition software, and more. The effectiveness of these and other 
	technologies is dependent on their ability to analyze sound mathematically. 
	While many of these devices have a great deal of technological sophistication, 
	even something as simple as the beep of a touchtone telephone has interesting 
	mathematics involved. This project addresses the following questions regarding 
	the sounds made by a touchtone telephone:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		How is a sound wave represented mathematically?</li>
	<li>
		How are the sounds from touchtone phones created and analyzed?</li>
	<li>
		Given a telephone number, how does a telephone generate the sounds 
		corresponding to the number’s digits?</li>
	<li>
		Given a sequence of sounds from a dialed telephone number, how can the digits 
		dialed be determined?</li>
	<li>
		In sound recordings, of telephone sounds or otherwise, how can the desired 
		audio signal be distinguished from random “noise”?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Areas of Application</h2>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
<p>
	All sounds are caused by vibrating objects that create pressure disturbances in 
	the surrounding air. As an object such as a tuning fork vibrates, the object 
	exerts forces on the air around it, causing areas of higher-pressure air to 
	propagate outward from the object. These high-pressure areas are called 
	compressions, and the lower-pressure areas between the compressions are known 
	as rarefactions. Together the compressions and rarefactions form a pressure 
	wave in the air that we perceive as sound. When a pressure wave reaches the 
	eardrum, the wave causes the eardrum to vibrate at the same frequency as the 
	wave. The inner ear and the brain convert this vibration into a perceived 
	sound.</p>
<p>
	Since sound is a periodic pressure wave, the sine function is often used to 
	model sound mathematically. However, not nearly all sounds have graphs that can 
	perfectly match a sine curve. A perfectly sinusoidal sound wave is called a 
	“pure tone.” Almost all sounds heard in the natural world, on the other hand, 
	are much more complex. Still, even complicated sounds are periodic waves, and 
	the sine function can be a building block for representing all types of sound.</p>
<p>
	Sine functions are used to generate the sounds a telephone makes when a 
	particular digit from the keypad is dialed. The tone produced by any number on 
	a telephone keypad is actually the average of two sine waves. The telephone 
	converts these sounds to electrical signals, which are then decoded to connect 
	you to the telephone whose number you dialed.</p>
<p>The chart below shows the two sound frequencies that are combined to produce the 
	tones for each number on a telephone keypad.</p>
