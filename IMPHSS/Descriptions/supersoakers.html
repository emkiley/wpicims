<h2>The Problem</h2>

					<p>
						One of the most popular new toys to hit the market in recent years is a new high-power water gun 
						called the SuperSoaker<sup>®</sup>.  This new technologically advanced water gun allows the user to shoot more 
						water a greater distance than ever before.  This provides an opportunity for more strategic and 
						intense water gun competitions and games.</p>
					<p>
						What affects the distance the SuperSoaker<sup>®</sup> will shoot the water?  Can one predict the distance a 
						SuperSoaker<sup>®</sup> will shoot?  Is the amount of water expelled per shot from the SuperSoaker dependent 
						upon the number of pumps?</p>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
					<p>
						For a simple explanation of the operation of a SuperSoaker<sup>®</sup>, the water chamber in the gun is first 
						filled with water.  The operator then “pumps” the water gun adding more and more air into the water 
						chamber.  Since water cannot be compressed to any great extent, the additional air added continues 
						to increase the pressure on the water in the water chamber.  The air pressure above the water 
						continues to increase as the number of pumps increases.  When the trigger is pulled, a water outlet 
						is opened in the chamber providing a place for the pressurized water to escape.  This is the stream 
						of water produced by the water gun. </p>
					<p>
						One needs to assume that an individual used the same SuperSoaker<sup>®</sup> throughout the testing, that it 
						operates in the same manner during each trial, and that the amount of water added to the SuperSoaker<sup>®</sup> 
						for each trial is constant.  Also, one will assume that the water gun was fired from the same location 
						and position each time, which eliminates the effect of gravity in the results of the test 
						trials.  Therefore, the distance traveled by the water is due to the velocity of the water coming out 
						of the gun.</p>
