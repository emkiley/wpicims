<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
	Modern production lines have to be designed to be as fast as possible with 
	almost no error. When producing millions of products a day how does a company 
	keep track of it all? The project describes how salt water taffy is made. The 
	process starts with mixing raw materials, which are then baked in ovens and 
	subsequently cooled. The taffy ingredients are pulled, folded and twisted on 
	special pulling machines. Finally, the mixture is put into an extruding and 
	cutting machine which produces pieces of wrapped taffy. In this project 
	students become design engineers. They will need to decide how many of each 
	machine the company needs, how long it will take to make taffy, and how much 
	raw material is needed each day.</p>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
<p>
	The production of taffy needs to be done as efficiently as possible while 
	adhering to the set of specifications below.</p>
<p>
	The taffy is produced by the following process:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Three different ingredients, X, Y and Z, are first combined in a large 
	container in a ratio by weight of 10:3:1.
	<li>
	Four separate types of machines are required: Mixers, Cooling Trays, Pullers, 
	and Extruders.
	<li>
	The 20-kilogram batches of the raw materials are mixed and heated for a period 
	of 4 hours.
	<li>
	This 20-kilogram syrup is cooled for a period of 8 hours.
	<li>
	The Puller/Stretcher takes 30 kilogram batches and kneads them for 4 hours.
	<li>
		The Extruder (which also cuts and wraps) takes 8 hours to process 30 kg of 
		taffy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Materials Included</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
	Problems regarding the number of machines and amounts of ingredients to 
	efficiently produce taffy
	<li>
		Three extensions to increase the length and/or difficulty level of the project</li>
</ul>
