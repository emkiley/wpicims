<h2>The Problem</h2>

					<p>
						EPA regulations to eliminate gasoline vapors from escaping into the atmosphere during vehicle 
						refueling have caused problems for systems monitoring vapor return from hoses at gasoline 
						stations.  Although many gasoline stations are required to install systems to extract vapor 
						from vehicle gasoline tanks, the EPA has mandated onboard refueling vapor recovery (ORVR) in 
						all cars produced after 1999.  ORVR is installed in the vehicle’s fuel system and it extracts 
						vapors from the vehicle’s tank.  As a result, it is difficult to determine the status of the 
						pump’s vapor return system.  The system could register very little to no vapor because of 
						blockage or because of the refueling of an ORVR vehicle.  Using data collected from one 
						station over a weekend of activity, can you tell which hoses are functioning properly and which 
						are blocked because of a fault?</p>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
					<p>
						"Veeder-Root is the world's leading supplier of automatic tank gauging and fuel management systems
						and one of the few companies in the industry to design, manufacture and service its own
						products.  Veeder-Root presently has tank monitoring systems in more than 500,000 underground
						storage tanks around the globe." (<a href="http://www.veeder.com/page/AutomaticTankGauges" target="_blank">http://www.veeder.com/page/AutomaticTankGauges</a>)  
						One of the product that Veeder-Root produces is the Enhanced Vapor Recovery (EVR) system found at
						gas station pumps.  If ten gallons of gasoline are dispensed into a tank, an equivalent amount
						of vapor should be recovered by the EVR.</p>
					<p>
						In 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency issued regulations mandating onboard conrols on
						vehicles.  Beginning in 2000, all new vehicles are designed with an onboard refueling vapor
						recover (ORVR) system.  In the vehicle's fueling system, vapors travel to a carbon-packed canister
						where they are absorbed.  The engine draws vapor into the intake manifold where it is used as
						fuel.  Instead of vapor collecting in the tank and then being forced out when the vehicle is
						refueld, the vehicle itself absorbs the vapor and recirculates them back into the engine.</p>
					<p>
						Efficient EVR systems should capture the escaping gasoline vapors from non-ORVR vehicles.  Statistical
						tests can be designed to determine when EVR systems installed on a particular hose has failed.  These
						tests are hampered by the presence of increasing numbers of ORVR vehicles.  Hoses registering no
						vapor returned may be working properly but have been used by ORVR vehicles.  Any new statistical
						tests must be able to differentiate between true failures of the EVR system and the presence of
						ORVR vehicles, the latter of which does not signify poor performance of the EVR system.</p>
