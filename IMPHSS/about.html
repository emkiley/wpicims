	Originally sponsored by the NSF and the result of a week-long conference in 
	June 2000, the Industrial Mathematics Project for High School Students (IMPHSS) 
	is designed to bring the excitement of industrial mathematics into the high 
	school classroom. The IMPHSS began with six industrial projects in 2000, but it 
	has expanded to more than twenty following the third <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/academics/Depts/Math/CIMS/Teachers/about.html" target="_blank">
	Mathematics in Industry Institute for High School Teachers</a> conference 
	from June 28 through July 2, 2004. This week-long conference is sponsored by 
	the <a href="http://www.gefund.org/" target="_blank">GE Foundation</a> with the 
	intent of increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities in 
	mathematics by showing them the exciting options available in real world 
	applications.</p>
<p>
	The Mathematics in Industry Institute and the Industrial Mathematics Project are organized by
	the <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/+CIMS" target="_blank">Center for Industrial 
	Mathematics and Statistics</a> (CIMS) at WPI.  CIMS was created in January 1997 in the <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/academics/Depts/Math/" target="_blank">
	Department of Mathematical Sciences</a> at WPI to foster links between 
	faculty, students and industry. CIMS organizes a <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National 
	Science Foundation (NSF)</a>-sponsored "Research Experience for 
	Undergraduates" Program in Industrial Mathematics. In this REU Program, ten 
	undergraduates, selected each year from across the United States, work for 
	eight weeks on industrial mathematics projects with industrial sponsors 
	including Aetna, Allmerica Financial, Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, BOSE, 
	Compaq, DEKA Research and Development, John Hancock, MCI, Morgan Construction, 
	Premier Insurance, United Technologies, UMass Medical Center, and Veeder-Root.  Those interested in
	any of the WPI CIMS activities should <a href="contact.html">contact CIMS.</a></p>
