<h2>The High School Industrial Math Project Database</h2>
<p>
	The WPI <strong>Industrial Mathematics Project for High School Students</strong> has 
	developed over 20 <a href="projects.html">industrial mathematics projects</a> for 
	high school students drawn from a variety of real-world situations. Projects 
	are available for every level of high school mathematics, from Algebra to 
	Calculus and Statistics. The length and scope of the projects are very flexible 
	- a project often contains enough material for a major, semester-long endeavor, 
	but its component parts can also be used as breif enrichment activities. Our <a href="projects.html">
		project database</a> contains downloadable versions of each of the 
	projects, ready to be assigned to students.</p>
	
<h2>What are industial math projects all about?</h2>
<p>
	Industrial mathematics problems are designed to connect traditional classroom 
	subjects with real-world applications, showing students how they might use 
	mathematics after they graduate. The projects put the focus on mathematics as a 
	way of thinking about problems and emphasizes problem formulation in addition 
	to problem solving. The problems encourage clear, logical thinking, connect 
	seemingly unrelated mathematics, and very often require decisions based on 
	imperfect information.</p>
<p>
	The current industrial projects are available by clicking on the <a href="projects.html">
		projects</a> menu item above. The projects deal with realistic problems 
	from industries as divers as finance, education, insurance, manufacturing, and 
	law enforcement, among others. Some of the specific projects include studies of 
	standardized test data; SuperSoaker water guns; the iBot, a high-tech 
	wheelchair; and the Amtrak train system.</p>
	
<h2>How can I use these projects in my classroom?</h2>
<p>
	With such a large and adaptable database of projects, you are sure to find 
	something that is both interesting to your students and applicable to their 
	level of mathematics. Some general suggestions for the use of these projects 
	are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Every project on this site is completely ready to be downloaded and assigned. 
	Each project contains goals for students, background information, suggested 
	excercises, and complete sample solutions. Taken as is, these projects are 
	challenging and stimulating activities for students that may be completed in class or 
	outside of class, individually or in groups.
	<li>
	Each project is subdivided into a number of smaller sections, many of which can 
	be assigned independently of each other. If time is short in your class, assign 
	one smaller section of a project to your students as a brief but enriching 
	activity.
	<li>
		These projects can even be the foundation of their own unique math class! At 
		Wachusett Regional High School in Holden, MA, the course 
		<a href="http://www.mec.edu/wachusett/mathmodelingsyllabus.pdf">
			"Mathematical Modeling in Industry, Science, and Government"</a> 
		is a successful project-based mathematics course based on the material from this 
		database. The broad scope of many of these projects makes them ideal for a long-term 
		group activity. 
	</li>
	<li>
		As an added challenge for students, teachers may even choose to 
		provide students with no more than a problem statement and some background 
		information. Allowing students to perform their own research and devise 
		creative solutions can have impressive results!
