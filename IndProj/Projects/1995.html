<h3>Investigation of Atmospheric Heating and Cooling Balance Using
MODTRAN3</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: USAF Phillips Lab at Hanscom Air Forces Base<br />
Advisor: Prof. Paul Davis<br />
Ph.D. Industrial Project</strong></p>

<p>Recent modifications to MODTRAN3, a 2 cm<sup>-1</sup> resolution radiative
transfer model, have permitted its transformation into a full flux divergence
algorithm. It is now possible to calculate heating and cooling rates arising
from both thermal and solar sources. The thermal calculations have been
validated against benchmark line-by-line (LBL) calculations provided as an
outgrowth of the InterComparison of Radiation Codes used in Climate Models (ICRCCM),
organized by Elligson and colleagues. The MODTRANS comparisons for separate
species (H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>) were all of
sufficient quality, usually falling within the range of LBL comparisons, to
warrant the extension to other species. Preliminary studies of the energy
balance of the atmosphere and effects on global warming due to increased levels
of both natural and man-made contaminants are now possible.</p>
