<h2>Industrial Projects</h2>

<h1>1995-96 Projects</h1>

<h3>Rod Path Geometry Study</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Morgan Construction Company<br />
Advisor: Prof. Bogdan Vernescu<br />
Students: Adam Garland, Marcie Noyes, Jeffrey Perlak</strong></p>
<p>Morgan Construction Company is the only American supplier of rolling mills. The
project developed several methods to simulate laying pipe paths and analyze
their process efficiency. Methods used include optimal control theory and
calculus of variations. In order to simulate the curves, several codes employing
numerical methods were implemented. This project received the 1996 Provost MQP
Award in Mathematics.</p>

<h3>Statistically Sound Experiments to Improve
Production Quality for Electronic Components</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Bose Incorporated<br />
Advisor: Prof. Joe Petruccelli<br />
Student: Brian Charest</strong></p>
</p>This project was sponsored by a leading audio speaker manufacturer. The student
worked on-site with the company for five months, providing assistance on five
different projects relating to statistics and quality control. The student
gained experience in the design and conduct of experiments, and in entering and
analyzing statistical data.</p>

<h3>Developing Strategies to Improve Decision Making in Casualty
Insurance</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Premier Insurance Company<br />
Advisor: Prof. Art Heinricher, Prof. Ansuman Bagchi<br />
Students: Ryan Betts, Rhett Brown</strong><br /></p>
<p>The project examined and proposed a solution to the Massachusetts automobile
insurance optimal cession strategy problem. It was shown that a simplified
quasi-linear model must have a corner point solution. A dynamic solution method
was developed for a complete formulation. In its entirety, the project landed
forceful insight and offered a conceptually elegant, computationally feasible
alternative to the industry's current problem.</p>

Advisors: Ansumman Bagchi, Ann Wiedie<br />
Student: Cathleen Connelly</strong><br /></p>

<h3>Quality Factor Analysis for Automobile Insurance</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Premier Automobile Insurance<br />
Advisors: Ansumman Bagchi, Arthur Heinricher, Ann Wiedie<br />
Students: Lee Blouin, Jeffrey Peterson, Ann Marie Sbriglio</strong><br /></p>

<h3>Investigation of Atmospheric Heating and Cooling Balance Using
MODTRAN3</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: USAF Phillips Lab at Hanscom Air Forces Base<br />
Advisor: Prof. Paul Davis<br />
Ph.D. Industrial Project</strong></p>
<p>Recent modifications to MODTRAN3, a 2 cm<sup>-1</sup> resolution radiative
transfer model, have permitted its transformation into a full flux divergence
algorithm. It is now possible to calculate heating and cooling rates arising
from both thermal and solar sources. The thermal calculations have been
validated against benchmark line-by-line (LBL) calculations provided as an
outgrowth of the InterComparison of Radiation Codes used in Climate Models (ICRCCM),
organized by Elligson and colleagues. The MODTRANS comparisons for separate
species (H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>) were all of
sufficient quality, usually falling within the range of LBL comparisons, to
warrant the extension to other species. Preliminary studies of the energy
balance of the atmosphere and effects on global warming due to increased levels
of both natural and man-made contaminants are now possible.</p>
