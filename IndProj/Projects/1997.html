<h2>Industrial Projects</h2>

<h1>1996-97 Projects</h1>

<h3>Robust Statistical Sampling to Improve the Effectiveness and
Reliability of On-Line Manufacturing</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Tambrands Incorporated<br />
Advisor: Prof. Ming Chen<br />
M.S. Thesis, 1 student involved</strong></p>
<p>This project was concerned with statistical quality control. The advisor of the
project, Professor Ming Chen, received a letter from the Quality Engineer of
that company on December 20, 1996 stating that the agreement between WPI and the
company on this project has been fulfilled. The letter went on to say that
&quot;... The combination of bridging the needs of industry with academia, and
coming out in a win-win situation, has been very satisfying.&quot;</p>

<h3>Mathematical Modeling in Metal Processing</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Morgan Construction Company<br />
Advisor: Prof. Bogdan Vernescu<br />
Students: Forest Lee-Elkin, William Montbleau, Stanislav Oks</strong></p>
<p>This project focuses on the wear of a mechanism called a Laying Pipe which coils
steel rod in rolling mills. A mathematical model for the mechanism's wear is
developed through a system of differential equations. Strong correlation is
shown with measured data. To improve the wear distribution, an optimal shape
problem is numerically solved using minimization techniques and finite
difference methods. A new shape is achieved through the improvement of the wear
distribution.</p>

<h3>Statistical Consulting</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Bose Incorporated<br />
Advisor: Prof. Joseph Petruccelli<br />
Student: Jason D. Wilbur</strong></p>
<p>The report summarizes four statistical studies conducted by a leading audio
speaker manufacturer. During a three month period, the author served as a
consultant to the company. There, he was involved with each of the four studies
to varying degrees. Statistical topics discussed in this report include
experimental design, data collection, analysis of variance, analysis of
covariance, pairwise comparisons of proportions, aliasing structures,
confounding patterns, testing for significance, and non-parametric methods of
analysis.</p>

<h3>Development of a Test Algorithm for Cession Strategies</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Premier Insurance Company<br />
Advisor: Prof. Arthur C. Heinricher, Prof. Ansu Bagchi, Prof. Ann Wiedie<br />
Students: Kristen Magnifico, Jeremy Olszewski, Daniele Recore</strong></p>
<p>New methods for computing and predicting the net gain or loss for a certain
cession strategy were explored for the Premier Insurance Company of
Massachusetts. Various one and two stage strategies were developed and compared
using different variables. The methods used and the programs developed can be
used by Premier to test future strategies. They can also be used to investigate
the sensitivity of the payoff and the strategies to fluctuations in certain
parameters, including CAR's deficit.</p>

<h3>Control of Simultaneous Motion in Shoulder Prostheses</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Liberty Mutual Insurance Group<br />
Advisors: Prof. Looft, F. J. (ECE) and Prof. P.W. Davis<br />
Students: Jason Wening, Nicole Robert, Colleen Fox</strong></p>
<p>This project developed a prototype electronic control unit to simultaneously
execute motions in more than one joint of a prosthesis. The first phase
established design parameters of the control unit by modeling the movements of a
prosthetic arm and predicted the inertial forces acting on a moving prosthesis.
The second phase built the motion control system and proved that digital signal
processing can be used with analog technology to control simultaneous motions
and counteract the predicted inertial forces.</p>

<h3>Measures of Credibility</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Allmerica Financial<br />
Advisor: Prof. Ansu Bagchi, Prof. Ann Wiedie<br />
Students: Nicole Burns, Richard Colby, Scott Lucarelli, Melissa Pitzen</strong></p>
<p>This project investigated new measures of credibility for Allmerica Financial, a
Worcester based insurance company. The current credibility measure has not been
updated in the recent past and a critical analysis was required to measure its
validity. In particular, the method of predicting future claims was analyzed
using three consecutive years of data from the recent past. The project
incorporated several new ideas into modifying Allmerica's current practices.
These resulted in better predictions for Allmerica's future claims values.</p>

<h3>A Bayesian Test for Trend in Case-Fatality Rate</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: University of Massachusetts Medical Center<br />
Advisor: Prof. Balgodin Nandram<br />
Students: Kathryn Sullivan, Timothy Doherty</strong></p>
<p>The Cochran-Armitage test is frequently used to test for trends among binomial
counts. The nonparametric order-restricted test is less common. We construct a
Bayesian test for a trend which removes some restrictions associated with the
Cochran-Armitage test and the order-restricted test We apply these tests to the
Worcester Heart Attack Study to assess decreasing trends in case-fatality rates
for patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infraction.</p>

<h3>Experience Rating</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Aetna UHSC<br />
Advisor: Prof. Ansuman Bagchi<br />
Student: William Cho</strong></p>

<h3>Mathematical Software Usability Testing</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsors: Macsyma, Incorporated, Wolfram Research (Mathematica), Waterloo Maple,
and Softwarehouse (Derive)<br />
Advisors: Prof. Joseph Fehribach and Prof. Ansuman Bagchi<br />
IQP, 3 students involved</strong></p>
<p>This project compared the ease of use of the mathematical software systems
Macsyma, Derive, Mathematica, and Maple for first and second year college
students.</p>
