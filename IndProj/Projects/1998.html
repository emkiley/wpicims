<h2>Industrial Projects</h2>

<h1>1997-98 Projects</h1>

<p><strong>Sponsor: Harvard Medical School and Center for Radiation Therapy<br />
Advisor: Prof. Ming Chen<br />
Student: Julie Fondurulia (Master of Applied Statistics)</strong></p>
<p>This goal of this project is to develop statistical methods to determine
important prognostic factors in studies of Prostate-Specific Antigen failures.</p>

<h3>ODE Toolkit</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Digital Equipment Corporation<br />
Advisor: Prof. Joseph Fehribach<br />
Co-Advisor: Prof. William Farr<br />
Students: R. Demar, A. Howes, and A. Palombizio (MQP)</strong></p>
This is a joint project with Harvey-Mudd to develop the package ODE Toolkit as a
Web-Based ODE solver.</p>

<h3>Mathieu Functions for Macsyma</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Macsyma, Inc.<br />
Advisor: Prof. Joseph Fehribach<br />
Students: B. Altieri and M. Vadeboncoeur (MQP)</strong></p>
<p>This project will help Macsyma develop several routines for their product
Macsyma, including a numerical evaluation package for the Mathieu's function.</p>

<h3>Mathematical Software Usability Testing</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Macsyma, Inc., Waterloo MAPLE, and Softwarehouse (Derive)<br />
Advisor: Prof. Joseph Fehribach<br />
Students: K. Lee and A. Rua (IQP)</strong></p>
<p>This project compares the ease of use between the mathematical software Macsyma,
Derive, and Maple for precalculus and early calculus high school students.</p>

<h3>Exploring Optimal Cession Strategies for Automobile Insurance</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Premier<br />
Advisor: Prof. Art Heinricher<br />
Students: T. Adams and D. Deacon (MQP)</strong></p>
<p>This project is studying dynamic optimization strategies that can be used by
Premier Insurance of Massachusetts to make cession decisions. This will build on
previous work and provide the company with a tool to compare the results from
different strategies as well as determine how the strategy and the payoff
changes with changes in the model parameters, especially changes in the state's
total deficit and cession strategies used by the rest of the insurance industry.</p>

<h3>Simulation of the Behavior of Variable Life Insurance</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: John Hancock<br />
Advisor: Prof. Ann Wiedie<br />
Students: D. Sickman (MQP)</strong></p>
<p>Development of a probabilistic (rather than deterministic as used before by the
company) approach to simulate the effect of stock market volatility on the
behavior of a variable life insurance policy. This approach was applied to
project the activity hypothetical policies, intended to achieve a given account
value (the death benefit), at various premium amounts. Distributions of the
minimum number of required premium payments, the account value in a given year,
and the year in which the policy was fully funded were approximated via
simulation.</p>

<h3>Differences in Patient Treatment Across Types of Health Plans</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts<br />
Advisor: Prof. Ann Wiedie<br />
Students: D. Atkinson, L. Bottos, and A. Capek</strong></p>
<p>Differences between managed care and indemnity health care plans have been a
topic of recent debate. Claims resulting from the treatment of members diagnosed
with asthma and/or arthritis were analyzed to compare the treatment of the same
condition by the same provider across the two types of health plans. Analysis
was performed for facility and for non-facility providers as trends were
different in each case. Specifically, tests were performed to determine
significant differences between types of plan in the mean cost per patient.
Also, the types of procedures performed on patients in each type of plan were
analyzed, and differences in the distributions of procedures (across and within
types of procedures) were tested for significance. The age and gender
distributions of the members, for whom claims were filed, were explored across
and within the two types of plans.</p>
