<h2>Industrial Projects</h2>

<h1>1998-99 Projects</h1>

<p><strong>Sponsor: Compaq Computer/Digital Equipments<br />
Advisor: Prof. Joseph Fehribach<br />
Student: Adam Howes</strong></p>
<p>ODEToolkit is a mathematical software module used to solve systems of
first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or single equations of first
or second order. ODEToolkit is written in JAVA, a platform independent
programming language that is ideal for developing programs to be used across the
World Wide Web. ODEToolkit uses a set of powerful solving routines written in
FORTRAN called ODEPACK to solve ODEs.</p>

<h3>Dangers of Diversification</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Aetna<br />
Advisor: Prof. Art Henricher<br />
Students: Jessica A. Buffone, Michael F. Bugbee</strong></p>
<p>There exists no single measure of risk that is appropriate to all investors, 
partly because there is no clear definition of risk. Investment strategies 
such as diversification are often used in an attempt to reduce risk. We analyze 
several risk and performance measures and discuss their implications for 
investors with various risk preferences. We then determine the correlation 
between these risk and performance measures to illustrate their similarities 
and differences. This project was done in cooperation with Aetna Retirement Services.</p>

<h3>An Assessment of MCI's Proactive Program at Charlton, MA</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: MCI<br />
Advisor: Prof. Balgobin Nandram<br />
Student: Samuel T. Lehane-Abraham</strong></p>
<p>This project compares the efficiency of MCI's circuit repair proactive program
in Charlton with all other MCI terminal sites across the country. Preliminary
analyses show that MCI at Charlton performs similar, yet slightly worse than the
other terminal sites combined. Both non-spatial and spatial (communication among
sites) models are used to make inference. With respect to circuit repair time
Charlton is better than a few and worse than a few, but on average was similar
to the other terminal sites.</p>

<h3>Inflationary Effects on Loss Reserves</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Travelers Insurance Co.<br />
Advisor: Prof. Ann Wiedie<br />
Student: Melissa A. Garrell and Karen M. Lee</strong></p>
<p>Accurate reserves for future claims are crucial to the financial success of an
insurance company. This project compares the reserving model currently used by
Travelers Property &amp; Casualty (retrospective in nature) to a model suggested
by Robert Butsic (prospective, allowing for changing inflationary trends). A
common mathematical language for the two models is developed, an Excel program
to implement them is written, and numerical simulations run to make comparisons.</p>

<h3>Finite Element Simulations in Plasticity</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Morgan Construction<br />
Advisor: Prof. Bogdan Vernescu<br />
Student: Xiao-Long Yu</strong></p>
<p>The project's goal is to provide a user-friendly, web-based system for solving
practical matching problems. Users are not expected to have any specialized
training. The matching engine takes care of interpreting user input and applying
appropriate algorithms. This report focuses on the theoretical foundations of
the matching engine.</p>

<h3>Pricing Guaranteed Variable Life Insurance</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: John Hancock<br />
Advisor: Prof. Ann Wiedie<br />
Student: Aaron Korthas and Shelby Woods</strong></p>
<p>By simulating hypothetical Medallion Variable Life Insurance policies,
appropriate premiums are determined to guarantee a death benefit for various
lengths of time under various investment scenarios. With these premiums there is
an estimated high probability of having an adequate account balance by the end
of the guarantee periods. As with any guarantee, John Hancock will lose money on
policies that fail. Additional fees are calculated to offset the expected losses
of failed policies.</p>

<h3>Statistical Consulting at BOSE</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: BOSE<br />
Advisor: Prof. Joseph Petruccelli<br />
Student: Bruce A. Cox</strong></p>
<p>For his Major Qualifying Project, the author served as a statistical consultant
to a leading audio component manufacturer. During a four-month period in the
1998-99 academic year, he participated in the design and conduct of four
studies, and in the analysis of data from these studies. During these studies
the author interacted with statisticians, engineers and production personnel.
Statistical topics discussed in this report include experimental design, data
collection, process stability and capability, confounding patterns, hypothesis
testing and pairwise comparison of variables.</p>
