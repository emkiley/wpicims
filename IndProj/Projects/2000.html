<h3>Credibility Analysis for Automobile Cession Strategies</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Premier Insurance<br />
Advisor: Prof. Art. Heinricher<br />
Student: Elizabeth Anne Hogan</strong></p>
<p>In Massachusetts, every person is guaranteed automobile insurance at
state-determined rates. Insurance companies cannot deny coverage, but can cede
the policy to an agency called CAR. Insurance companies need good estimates for
expected loss on a policy in order to make the best cession decision. The
cession decision is difficult to make where data is sparse. This project
describes two ways that a company can use loss data to obtain better predictions
for in groups with sparse data.</p>

<h3>Pricing a Waiver of Premium Upon Disability</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.<br />
Advisor: Prof. Ann Wiedie<br />
Students: Jovanna Rose Baptista, Larissa L. Gilbreath, Robert A. Jaeger</strong></p>
<p>Development of approaches to price a waiver of premium upon disability rider
based on provision terms set forth by John Hancock Insurance and available data.
Approaches involved random variables; age at disablement, duration of
disability, and age at death. A rider premium was calculated such that the
random loss (a function of those random variables) had an expected value of
zero. Through data collection and SAS programming, an expense-loaded rider
premium was calculated as a percentage of base premium.</p>
