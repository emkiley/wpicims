<h3>Pricing a Long-Term Care Rider on Variable Life Insurance</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: John Hancock<br />
Advisor: Prof. Ann Wiedie<br />
Student: Jeffery Bresson</strong></p>
<p>Variable universal life insurance (VUL) is a product in which the policyholder
chooses the size of the premium and also the type of fund into which the premium
is invested once fees are removed. In fact, it is often sold as an investment
vehicle more so than a life insurance policy. An optional <i>rider</i> to this
policy is an accelerated benefit feature, in which the policyholder can receive
monthly payments should they require long-term care (LTC). In this instance, the
payments will be a fixed percentage of the death benefit minus payments already
made, to a maximum of half of the death benefit, so that the LTC payments are
made for ~2 years. The portion of the death benefit not made as LTC payments
will be paid upon death. The cost of this rider will be determined through this
project.</p>

<h3>Pricing Structured Settlement Universal Life Insurance</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: CGU Insurance<br />
Advisor: Prof. Ann Wiedie<br />
Student: Briane Lane and Matthew Bielik</strong></p>
<p>In a structured settlement (e.g. a lawsuit to pay for care of a child injured to
the extent that they require some form of care for life) an additional
consideration might be family protection, a type of universal life policy funded
by a single premium immediate annuity (SPIA). In the event of the death of the
caregiver, the death benefit will be paid to compensate for the cost of the care
which had been provided by the caregiver. The project will calculate premiums
for this product and resulting cash values for the policy, as well as perform
profit tests and develop an illustration spreadsheet to be used easily by
brokers. The premiums must be determined to meet all nonforfeiture laws.</p>

<h3>Computer Characterization of Microwave High-Power Loads</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: The Ferrite Company, Inc.<br />
Advisor: Prof. Vadim Yakovlev and Prof. Reinhold Ludwig<br />
Student: Hauke Marshall</strong></p>
<p>Water loads are widely used in high power systems of microwave heating to absorb
energy non-absorbed by the processed material. In the project, the load designed
for a 915 MHz 75 kW transmitter (a segment of a rectangular waveguide containing
a conical cavity filled with water) is simulated with the use of QuickWave-3D,
electromagnetic modeling software based on conformal FDTD method. Coupling of
the system and patterns of power dissipated in the water cone are analyzed as
functions of geometrical parameters and temperature of water. Obtained data
should be used to generate information on any inherent power limitation in these
loads and to design similar loads with good operating characteristics for other
transmitters.</p>

<h3>Finite-Element Modeling of Heat Transfer in Porous Media</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: DEKA<br />
Advisor: Prof. Christopher Lasen and Prof. Bogdan Vernescu<br />
Student: Brian Ball</strong></p>
<p>The project provides the mathematical model and a numerical technique for a
particular fluid flow problem.</p>

<p><strong>Sponsor: Enersyst Development Center, LLC, Dallas, TX<br />
Advisor: Prof. Vadim Yakovlev<br />
Student: Veronika Mechenova</strong></p>
<p>Electromagnetic modeling software available in the market is studied to compose
and maintain contemporary database of codes applicable to designing of
industrial systems of microwave thermal processing. Selected codes are evaluated
in accordance with specific criteria in order to work out certain
recommendations for microwave power industry. Data for comparison of efficiency
and computational characteristics are generated by solving a series of benchmark
problems formulated as associated with the typical systems of the field and
allowing experimental verification. Among the codes participating in the study
are Ansoft's HFSS, Matra S&amp;I's EMC2000-VF, CST's Microwave Studio, and
QWED's QuickWave-3D. Particular attention is paid to the accuracy, identity of
computations, and convergence of the results.</p>

<p><strong>Sponsor: Veeder-Root<br />
Advisor: Prof. Ming-Hui Chen and Prof. Joseph Petruccelli<br />
Student: Jai Liu</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this study is to estimate the performance of leak detection
equipment installed in operating underground fuel storage tank systems. The
effort will concentrate on both tanks and pressurized pipelines.</p>
