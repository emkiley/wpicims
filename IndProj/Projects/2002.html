<h3>Recreating Lost Records of Insurance Transactions</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: John Hancock<br />
Advisors: Ann Weidie, Bogdan Doytchinov<br />
Students: Alison Hughes, Devin Rahn</strong><br /></p>
<p>This project developed an algorithm for recreating 
lost financial transactions for John Hancock. 
Specifically, it recreates premium, dividend, and 
loan transactions lost during the annual back up 
process in the years 1993 and 1998, using existing 
transactions and current aggregate amounts. In instances 
where random policyholder behavior was predicted, statistical 
analysis of historical policy behavior was provided. Recreation 
for some policies and fields was a deterministic problem, while 
other fields and policies were identified as not restorable 
by the algorithm.</p>

<h3>Mathematical Models for the Spread of Damage in Organizational Networks</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Lehman Brothers<br />
Advisor: Arthur C. Heinricher<br />
Student: Melissa St. Hilaire</strong><br /></p>
<p>This project describes mathematical models for 
how damage, measured in lost capacity, can spread 
through an organization. The model allows a company 
to simulate damage spread and compare different strategies 
for allocating repair resources after the initial 
damage has occurred. This project was completed in 
collaboration with Lehman Brothers investment firm 
in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in September 11, 2001.</p>

<h3>Stochastic Modeling for Reserve Calculations</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Sun Life Financial<br />
Advisors: Arthur C. Heinricher, Ann Wiedie<br />
Students: Ondrej Cistecky, Steve Tribandis</strong><br /></p>
<p>A stochastic model is developed in APL and used to 
simulate the full distribution of present value of future 
costs of Sun Life Financials' extended death benefit 
claims. The program is proposed as a valuation tool 
which enables the development of realistic reserve levels. 
Using actual claim data and Sun Life assumptions simulation 
is used to verify that current reserve levels on extended 
death benefit claims are overly conservative.</p>
