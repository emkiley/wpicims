<h3>Estimating Adequacy of Life Insurance Reserves</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: John Hancock<br />
Advisors: Ann Weidie, Arthur C. Heinricher<br />
Student: Shawn Hallinan</strong><br /></p>
<p>This project created a tool that will allow John Hancock 
to test how adequate their reserves are for a given life insurance 
policy under varying interest rates and mortality assumptions 
for each individual. Policies were tested and analyzed to 
estimate the parameters that would make them adequate. John 
Hancock was presented with this tool that returns adequacy 
results across different interest rate scenarios and morality 
distributions, where an adequate policy implies that it is funded 
sufficiently to cover expenses.</p>

<h3>Vapor Leak Detection for an Underground Storage Tank</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: The Ferrite Company, Inc.<br />
Advisor: Roger Lui<br />
Students: Brian Lehtinen, Mike Pyzocha</strong><br /></p>
<p>This project models the pressure inside the vapor space of a UST. 
The model takes into account dispensing activities, vapor recovery, 
evaporation and leaks in the system. Using mass balance, a system of 
ordinary differential equations is obtained. The equations are solved 
numerically and two of the variables in the equations are optimized 
to find the leak rate. Results are tested against data from Veeder-Root Company.</p>

<h3>Complex Permittivity Reconstruction with Neural Networks</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: The Ferrite Company, Inc.<br />
Advisor: Vadim Yakovlev<br />
Student: Gregory S. Pettigrew</strong><br /></p>
<p>This project deals with an original method of determination of 
dielectric properties of materials, based minimally on measurements 
and heavily on modeling. Permittivity is reconstructed by a neural 
networking procedure matching measured and modeled characteristics 
of reflection. The experimental part of the method is implemented. 
Operation of the method is demonstrated through validation and 
determination of permittivity of liquid substances. Experimental 
and computational studies reveal important features of the current 
implementation and generate recommendations regarding its further development.</p>
