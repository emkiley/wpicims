<h3>Predicting the Number of Annual Customers at Four Local Funeral Homes</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Pillsbury Funeral Home<br />
Advisor: Jason D. Wilbur<br />
Students: Emmanuel V. Go, Allison Joy Schafer</strong><br /></p>
<p>The purpose of this project was to forecast the future business of four 
funeral homes operated by Pillsbury Funeral Homes in the Worcester County 
area. The statistical knowledge and skills employed in this project include 
database design. data collection, exploratory data analysis, use of life 
tables and the US Census data, hypothesis testing and the fitting of

<h3>Operations Management for Outdoor Lighting Replacement</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: National Grid<br />
Advisors: Alex Mango (National Grid), Andrew W. Swift, John Walter (National Grid)<br />
Students: Laura Hayes, Patrick Malloy</strong><br /></p>
<p>This project sought to determine whether spot or group relamping would 
be a more efficient maintenance system for National Grid. Through 
interpolation and extrapolation of partial survival functions, we 
constructed a probability for the failure time of one lamp. We used 
rejection sampling to draw failure times from our density function, and 
completed the number of a group of lamps over a period of time. We were 
then able to estimate when spot or group replacement prevailed.</p>
