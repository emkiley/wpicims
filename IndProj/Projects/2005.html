<h3>Gravity Waves over Topography</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: George Jumper, AFRL, Hanscom Air Force Base<br />
Advisor: Mayer Humi<br />
Student: Kevin Fichter</strong><br /></p>
<p>This project examined the theory behind gravity wave analysis 
and derived methods for detecting the presence of gravity waves 
from experimental data. To this end we used the Taylor-Goldstein 
equation and data gathered from the French Alps as part of an 
international campaign to detect and analyze gravity waves 
generated by topography. We were able to relate the experimental 
and expected values of the wavelength and frequency of the 
gravity waves using a fluid dynamics model.</p>

<h3>Computer Modeling of Cell Migration</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Yu-li Wang, University of Massachusetts Medical School<br />
Advisor: Roger Lui<br />
Students: Kelly Pui-Kwan Fung, David Govonlu</strong><br /></p>
<p>The study of amoeboid movement in crawling cells has been a wide 
topic of interest in the field of cell biology. This project focuses 
on the development of a computer program that simulates the steps 
of cell crawling. A statistical analysis of the variables used in 
the program helps to provide a better understanding of the 
underlying factors behind amoeboid movement. This provides insight 
into what accounts for the various shapes and behaviors 
seen among crawling cells.</p>

<h3>Modeling of Malignant Brain Tumors</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: IBM<br />
Advisor: Suzanne Weekes<br />
Student: David Voutila</strong><br /></p>
<p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly lethal brain cancer, accounts 
for over 30 percent of brain tumors in adult patients. Patients typically 
survive only 12-18 months after diagnosis. Our model describes the dynamics 
of GBM via a system of partial differential equations for tumor cells, 
nutrients, toxins, and mechanical resistance of brain matter. Using a 2D 
conservative Alternating Direction Implicit scheme, we numerically 
approximate the solution to our model and implement it in C 
for simulation on a parallel computer.</p>

<h3>A Mathematical Analysis of a Jitter-based Hardware Random Number Generator</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: General Dynamics<br />
Advisor: William Martin<br />
Student: Wayne Coppock</strong><br /></p>
<p>In this paper analysis of jitter is conducted to determine its suitability for 
use as an entropy source for a true random number generator. Efforts are taken to 
isolate and quantify jitter in ring oscillator circuits and to understand its 
relationship to design specifications. The accumulation of jitter via various 
methods is also investigated to determine whether there is an optimal accumulation 
technique for sampling the uncertainty of jitter events. Mathematical techniques 
are used to analyze the accumulation process and an attempt at modeling a signal 
with jitter is made. The physical properties responsible for the noise that causes 
jitter are also briefly investigated.</p>

<h3>Optimization of the Sierpinski Carpet Fractal Antenna</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Steven Best, AFRL, Hanscom Air Force Base<br />
Advisor: Vadim Yakovlev<br />
Student: Brian G. Cordes</strong><br /></p>
<p>The Sierpinski Carpet fractal antenna is studied in terms of optimality. A 3D 
full-wave FDTD model of the structure is developed and used in conjunction with 
a neural network optimization procedure. An original engineering design based on 
the idea of a broken fractal geometry is suggested. The modified fractal antennas 
are shown to have the capability of being optimized, in terms of its input 
impedance, in a narrow frequency band.</p>

<h3>Estimating the Cost of Volatility in an Assigned Risk Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Premier Insurance<br />
Advisors: Jon Abraham, Arthur Heinricher<br />
Students: Vonda Bui, Ying Fang Yu</strong><br /></p>
<p>This project studied the new assigned risk plan for Massachusetts automobile 
insurance. The current method is a simple lottery in which each company's 
voluntary market share determines its probability of receiving the next 
high-risk driver. Results show that a dynamic method that adjusts assignment 
probabilities according to each company's current residual market share can 
reduce volatility costs by 50% for all insurance companies in the state.</p>

<h3>Estimating Disability Incidence Rates for Long Term Care Insurance</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: John Hancock<br />
Advisors: Jon Abraham, Art Heinricher<br />
Students: Michael D'Onofrio, James Lescoe, Jeffrey Simone, Mareck Twarong</strong><br /></p>
<p>This paper uses data from the 1999 NLTCS and NHIS surveys to compute Long 
Term Care (LTC) prevalence rates. We develop several triggers, evaluate 
a test of cognitive ability, and compute prevalence rates for each trigger. We 
develop a model to compute LTC incidence rates based on the prevalence data. 
We find that incidence is a strictly increasing function of age and that there 
is a sharp increase in incidence rates starting at age ninety.</p>
