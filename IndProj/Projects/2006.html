<h3>Mathematical Modeling of Torque for Screw Insertion Process</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: BOSE Corporation<br />
Advisor: Suzanne L. Weekes<br />
Students: Angela A. Leo, Sanjayan Manivannan, John R. Potter</strong><br /></p>
<p>A self-tapping screw is a high-strength one-piece fastener that is driven into 
preformed holes. We analyze and improve a mathematical model of the self-tapping 
screw insertion process so that it can be used in manufacturing processes at the 
BOSE Corporation. We build a Graphical User Interface in MATHLAB which allows 
users to enter fundamental data and produces the corresponding torque curve. The 
accuracy and robustness of the model is tested by comparing predictions to 
empirical data collected at BOSE.</p>

<h3>Expert System Design for Long-Term Care Underwriting</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: John Hancock<br />
Advisor: Jon P. Abraham<br />
Students: Elizabeth A. Arsenault, Nicholas E. Rackliff</strong><br /></p>
<p>The project presents a mathematical model created to determine a risk score 
for applicants for Long-Term Care insurance. We developed software to assist in 
the implementation and testing of the model. We analyze the suitability of 
our model, including the sensitivity of scores to the model's parameters. We 
formulate methods which could help train the model, including numerical regression 
to solve for model parameters and pair-wise comparisons between applicants to 
verify consistency of parameters and risk factors.</p>

<h3>Lehman Brothers: Risk Reporting and Technology</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: Lehman Brothers<br />
Advisors: Arthur Gerstenfeld, Michael J. Ciaraldi, Jon P. Abraham<br />
Students: William Braden Hays, Amy Louise Jackson, Jason T. Tondreau, Igor Ushakov</strong><br /></p>
<p>The main goal of this project was to improve risk reporting and technology 
at Lehman Brothers for both country and credit risk. The project was divided 
into two separate parts that were completed in parallel. One part was 
completed in New York which focused on the improvement of the country risk 
reporting process. The other was executed in London to consolidate 
foreign-exchange spot credit limits.</p>

<h3>Robustifying Logistic Regression: An Application to Obesity</h3>
<p><strong>Sponsor: National Center for Health Statistics/CDC<br />
Advisor: Balgobin Nandram<br />
Student: William Marjerison</strong><br /></p>
<p>We predict finite population mean BMI nationally for children and 
adolescents using NHANES III survey data. There are many nonrespondents 
and no distributional assumption is made on BMI. As link functions for 
response indicators, we compare the logistic distribution assumption 
is made on BMI. As link functions for response indicators, we compare 
the logistic distribution and student's mixtures. Nonrespondents are 
assigned cells based on propensity scores to impute BMI, and uncertainty 
about this process is included. Predictive inference is done using 
least-squares, and we compare results with a recent method.</p>
