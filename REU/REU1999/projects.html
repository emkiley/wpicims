<p>Currently, John Hancock's policy holders have the option of paying an
additional six dollars per thousand dollars of coverage in order to add a child
rider onto their insurance policy. In the case of a child's death, John Hancock
pays the primary insured a death benefit. In the case of the death of the
primary insured, John Hancock will then continue paying the annual fee of six
dollars per thousand for the child until the child reaches age 21. The children
also have the option of converting the policy to up to five times its original
value without being underwritten once the children turn 21. This cost of six
dollars per thousand dollars coverage remains constant regardless of the number
of children in the household or the age of the children (after the children are
older than 14 days).</p>

<p>However, this price of six dollars per thousand dollars of coverage was
calculated thirty years ago using only very rough estimates. Thus, the goal of
this project is to develop a method by which to accurately calculate the cost of
this policy.</p>

<p>In most rolling mills, the metal rods are coiled by pushing them through a
pipe that has a corkscrew-like shape, called the laying pipe. The goal of this
project is to model the wear distribution along a laying pipe and to find the
shape of the pipe that has the least wear. A lower and better distributed wear
extends the life of the pipe and reduces the down time of the mill, thus
increasing the productivity.
<p>Given specific boundary conditions on the geometry of the pipe, we derived a
shape dependent expression for wear from the forces involved. In finding the
optimal shape that reduces the wear, we plan on using techniques such as
calculus of variations, optimal control, and numerical methods to solve the
differential equations involved.</p>

<h2>Statistical Models Predicting Demand for Loans Against Permanent Life

<p>The purpose of this project is to find a model or several models that will
allow John Hancock to understand and predict the loan demand policyholders of
permanent life insurance policies will borrow against their type of policy. We
will determine if there is a seasonal trend in demand for loans against John
Hancock’s life insurance policies and we will identify the significant
predictors of changes in loan demand. We will also determine if there is a time
lag between a change in the predictor variables and a change in the demand for
loans. The amount of loan assets is constantly changing, therefore, we need to
have a dynamic model for this problem.
<p>In order to validate the model, we will use data from 1970 to 1997 to predict
1998 loan demand. We will then check our error to see how close the predicted
loan demand is to the actual loan demand.</p>

<p>Undeerground pressurized pipe leak detecting can be done when a closed pipe
is idle by using a single pressure sensor to observe the pressure decay caused
by a leak. But pressure changes caused by inital temperature conditions driving
thermal flow can either mask a leak or cause false alarms. The project proposes
to develop mathematical models to accurately described thermal and leak induced
pressure versus time data so that leaks can be distinguished from thermal
interference.</p>
