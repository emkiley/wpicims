<p>This project is sponsored by Morgan Construction Company. Morgan specializes
in the production of steel rolling mills. Part of this process involves a laying
pipe which shapes the flexible steel rod into a coil. This project focuses on
the path the rod follows in the pipe. All current knowledge about the laying
pipe assumes the rod follows the centerline of the pipe. This year's project
dismisses this assumption in an effort to find a more realistic path of the rod.
With this knowledge, we hope to improve on previous calculations of the wear
profile, with an end toward finding an optimal design of the laying pipe. In
conjunction with this, the effect of changing the diameter of the pipe will be
studied.</p>

<p>The goal of the project is to develop a tool to identify agents or agencies
whose loss experience is significantly different from the expected loss
experience for the group. Statistical tests will use company policy and claims
data for 1997, 1998, and 1999 and focus on loss ratio, claims frequency, and
claims size as measures of loss experience. The data will be grouped and
analyzed according to what quality factors best model the loss experience of
agents. The software tool will flag agents for an unusual loss experience based
on the distribution of their book of business.</p>
