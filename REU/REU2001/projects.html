<p>The iBot is a motorized wheel-chair, designed by DEKA, that sits on two axles
with equally sized wheels. The iBot is able to perform tasks such as climbing
stairs, and going over curbs. The wheelchair is also able to transfer into a
2-wheel mode, with one axle on top of the other. Our job is to model the
system's transition from two wheel to four wheel mode. We are using methods such
as Hamilton's Principle, dynamics, and time-optimal control.</p>

<p>A lack of potable water accounts for widespread illness in more impoverished
regions of the world; the problem can be addressed in part by implementing
efficient water distillation systems. In conjuction with DEKA Research and
Development, our task is to model fluid flow through a positive displacement
pump within a dynamic distillation system. Emphasis is placed on describing the
physical properties of the water flowing through the pump, particularly
phase-transition during compression and expansion states.</p>

<p>This year's project with Veeder-Root involves monitoring vapor return
equipment for gasoline stations. When a vehicle refuels at a gas station,
gasoline vapors escape from the vehicle's tank into the atmosphere.
Environmental regulations now require stations in several states to capture
these emissions and prevent their escape into the atmosphere. In addition, the
EPA has mandated controls on all new cars and light-trucks to capture these
gasoline vapors. Our goal for the project is to determine when the vapor return
system at the gas station has failed. Failure occurs when the system returns no
vapors. We must determine when little or no vapor returned is due to the
refueling of these new vehicles or to the failure of the vapor return equipment.
Various statistical tests are employed to determine true failure of the vapor
return systems.</p>
