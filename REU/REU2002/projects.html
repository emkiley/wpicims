<p>The project, sponsored by Applied Mathematics, Inc., is studying the fluid
flow through an electro-pneumatic pulsed jet actuator, which consists of a
miniature valve connected to a convergent nozzle by a small flow chamber. The
fluid flow is considered to be one-dimensional, compressible, and isentropic.
The goal is to understand a steady state model for the actuator and extend the
model for the dynamic case. The system will be optimized for maximum output
using the variables of flow air pressure and temperature, source air pressure
and temperature, actuator frequency, and duty cycle.</p>

<p>Currently, there exist hearing aids that distinguish speech from particular
background noises, e.g., air-conditioning, but considerable work is required to
enhance speech in a general noisy environment. In conjunction with DEKA Research
and Development, our task is to create a test bed to evaluate such devices. The
project consists of two parts: one is modeling conversation in a noisy
environment, and the other is developing a measure for speech transmission
quality. By obtaining and testing various sound data, we will determine the
tolerance level for processing errors so that the signals sent to the user
remain intelligible. We make extensive use of Fourier analysis in our
mathematical study of acoustics, and work in the MATLAB technical computing
environment.</p>

<p>In most states, gas stations are required to have equipment that will collect
and contain harmful vapors emitted during the refueling process. Stations must
also have diagnostic systems in place that continuously monitors key aspects of
the vapor recovery systems. The diagnostic system must issue a warning if any of
these key components is not operating within required limits. Our goal this year
is to develop statistical tests that will certify that the monitoring systems
meet the standards set by CARB. In particular, we focus on failure-mode tests in
which artificial failures are created for the system to identify. These tests
may become part of the certification procedure used by CARB.</p>
