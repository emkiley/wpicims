Currently, a person diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM), a highly invasive
 cancer of the structural cells in the brain, has an extremely low chance of 
long-term survival.  One of the obstacles in treating GBM is the inability 
of current medical imaging technology to observe growth at an extremely 
small scale.  Our task, in cooperation with IBM Corporation and researchers
at Harvard University, is to develop a 
continuum model that accounts for both the proliferation and migration of 
tumor cells.  In formulating this model, we will use a system of partial 
differential equations to describe the dynamics of the tumor and its effects 
on the surrounding brain tissue.  In addition, we will employ finite 
difference methods to approximate the solution to the system.  
Our goal is to utilize our model in understanding patterns and initial 
stages of tumor growth.

The Massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance market is in poor 
condition. Thirty-four of the fifty-three companies that wrote insurance 
in the state in 1990 have left the state since then, while only three
 have entered. Of the 34 that left, 
30 paid a large 'buy out' fee to leave the state.  The reasons for 
this situation are complex, but they can broadly be explained by the market 
structure Massachusetts uses to handle high risk drivers. Over the next few 
years, a new market structure for handling these risks will be implemented. 
Our task is to model this new structure.

With the support of New Frontier Advisors, our group at WPI is
working on a problem within the finance world; to optimize returns
while minimizing risk, as measured by the asset covariance matrix.
The ultimate goal would be to find the true covariance matrix,
from which the efficient frontier can be derived. However, since
the true covariance matrix is impossible to completely determine,
several models have been proposed to estimate it. Unfortunately,
no single model estimates the covariance matrix in a superior way.
Thus, we will combine models in order to minimize the error
involved within the final model. From this new covariance matrix,
we can come up with an efficient frontier which represents the
portfolios which will yield optimal points of return versusrisk.
