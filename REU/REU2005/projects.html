In a microwave oven, food is heated as a result of two simultaneous
physical processes: absorption of electromagnetic energy (as a result of
the transmission of electromagnetic waves), and heat diffusion. It is
known from experience that microwave heating can often be very non-uniform
and hard to control. A system of coupled partial differential equations
modeling these two phenomena is formulated but it is impossible
to solve exactly except in trivial cases.  We investigate the use of the
finite element method software FEMLAB in obtaining numerical solutions to
our coupled system. We hope our model aids in designing microwave ovens
which have more control over how food is heated.

<p> This project develops a portfolio optimization algorithm tailored to the special structure provided by constraints on the sum of the absolute values of the positions; a book size constraint.  The program  generates the efficient frontier by scanning for corner portfolios, using the fact that optimal portfolios must satisfy a combination of equations (for each stock which is not zero) and inclusions (for each stock that is not in the solution).

A term life insurance policy pays out a death benefit to its
beneficiary
provided that the insured individual dies within the term of the
policy..
There are situations in which the insurance company may wish to extend
the
length of the term life insurance policy. Since such a contract
extension
increases the length of time that the individual is insured, there is
an
associated cost to the company. The focus of this project, proposed by
John
Hancock Life Insurance Company, is to use various mathematical and
statistical tools to estimate this cost. The final product includes a
Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications software tool, which actuaries
at
John Hancock can use to estimate the cost of extending any given term
life
insurance policy.
