Long-term Care Insurance underwriters analyze all of the data provided
in an application to assess the risk associated with the applicant.  The
work described here focuses on the applicant's medical conditions and
computes a numerical risk score based on these conditions.  The model
uses a least squares approach to determine how the risk points for
several independent medical conditions will accumulate.  It includes an
additional penalty for comorbid medical conditions.  The model has the
advantage of objectivity; two applicants with the same set of medical
conditions will always receive the same risk score.  Results from
testing with simulated data show that the model is efficient and
eliminates error quickly when the sources of error can be isolated.

BOSE Inc. uses self-tapping screws in many of its manufacturing processes.
The main goals of this project are</p>
<ul>
	<li>to find the torque required to tighten the self-tapping screw without
material failure, and</li>
	<li>to improve a mathematical model of the torque needed for the screw
insertion process by including heat generation.</li>
</ul>

The Ferrite Company, Inc. has shown interest in minimizing the time required for efficient 
microwave heating in industrial applications by regulating power supplied to the system. We 
aim to model this situation in 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional formulations, solving analytically 
and numerically the two-way coupled system of differential equations governing electromagnetic 
power and heat diffusion, and to investigate the feasibility of the use of a pulsing power 
source in order to optimize efficiency of microwave heating systems.
