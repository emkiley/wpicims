State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) is the largest institutional asset manager in
the world. As such, SSgA is interested in modeling monthly stock returns and managing
optimal bond portfolios. We will all be working on two related projects: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Stocks project: Develop a model to evaluate and rank future performance of stocks,
        based on some known factors, such as value, growth, sentiment, and quality. Since
        the data is extremely noisy and will likely cause the model to change from month
        to month, we are also interested is making this model smooth over time to minimize
        stock trading costs. Regression will be our primary tool for model building; however,
        alternatives such as artificial neural networks will be examined as well. </li>


    <li>Bonds project: A bond is a measure of debt issued by an institution. Investors commonly
        include bonds in their portfolios due to the fact that they are less volatile than
        stocks. However, bonds are associated with a risk of default, measured by credit
        ranking agencies, from AAA -- least risky to D -- most risky. This project will
        analyze investment grade bonds: A and BBB bonds issued by non-financial companies.
        For each bond issuer, State Street has computed a score, which tries to predict
        how well the bond will perform compared to treasury bonds. Given 160 months of benchmark
        portfolio weights, returns, and these scores, we seek to construct a portfolio that
        beats the corporate bond index. To verify the results, comparisons of our rankings
        against the benchmark returns and simulations will be conducted.</li>
</ul>

A self-tapping screw is a high-strength one-piece fastener that is driven into preformed
    holes. The goal of the Major Qualifying Project (MQP) completed by A. Leo, et al.
    and the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU2006) completed by Miller, et al.
    was to create a mathematical model that allows users to input data about their self-tapping
    screw and the material it is entering and output a torque curve which models the
    fastening process. We improve the algorithm to include the modeling of the failure
    of the joint as well as a model for the clamp load of the joint. We will also develop a
    model of heat dynamics in the screw that considers the rate of screw insertion, i.e. RPM.

In the process of drug development, it is important to understand the pharmacokinetics
of candidate compounds. Among the pharmacokinetic parameters of interest is hepatic
clearance, which is the rate at which blood is cleared of the drug by the liver.
Generally, point estimates for hepatic clearance are obtained from preclinical data
and used in clinical models without accounting for the uncertainty in these estimates.
The goal of this project is to construct a Bayesian model for hepatic clearance
which can be used to quantify the uncertainty in terms of a posterior distribution
and evaluate the sensitivity of the distribution to various model assumptions.
