Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly lethal brain cancer--patients
typically survive 12-18 months after diagnosis with treatment, and only
six months without.  Our continuum model describes the dynamics of GBM via
a system of nine partial differential equations involving tumor cell,
nutrient, toxin, and chemoattractor densities. We allow for
genetic instability of the tumor cells by considering five different
tumor cell clone types which may mutate upon proliferation.  The mutations
follow a linear progression pathway from clone A (the least
aggressive type) to clone E (the most aggressive type).  Since our model
is macroscopic in nature, a key objective is to obtain results similar to
those produced by previous agent-based models set on a microscale.  Using
numerical methods, we approximate the solution to our model in MATLAB
and conduct in-silico experiments.

Grinblatt and Han (2005) model momentum using the frameworks of Prospect Theory 
and Mental Accounting (PT/MA).  These frameworks explain the tendency of some 
investors to hold onto losing stocks too long and sell winning stocks prematurely, 
resulting in price distortions in the market which appear as momentum as market
forces act to correct these discrepancies.  Using stock market data provided by 
State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), we compare Grinblatt and Han's model with 
some traditional, empirically motivated measures of momentum. We utilize the 
information coefficient (IC), the correlation between a model's prediction and 
actual outcomes, as a metric of testing success.  Although results show that the 
PT/MA model has some predictive power, the model does about the same, if not worse
than traditional momentum measures at forecasting stock movements, leading us to 
conclude that PT/MA based momentum should not replace traditional measures of momentum 
when forecasting stock prices.

Patients often withdraw from clinical trials for various
reasons, including adverse health effects, lack of drug efficacy, and
death. The resulting missing data poses a problem for analysis of the
data. The goal of this project was to understand the effect of various
types of missing data on the analysis of a clinical trial for a
degenerative disease such as Alzheimer's Disease.  Data were simulated
based on the expected longitudinal progression of a clinical trial for
an Alzheimer's Disease Disease Modifying (ADDM) drug, with varying
degrees of variation and missingness. Missingness was simulated as
Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR) and Missing
Not at Random (MNAR). Analysis of these simulated data showed that
complete cases analysis and multiple imputation (MI) are more
appropriate for this type of clinical study than the standard Last
Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) approach, yielding higher power and
lower bias. We present recommendations for use of specific methods for
various combinations of the standard deviation, degree of missingness,
type of missingness, and other parameters.
