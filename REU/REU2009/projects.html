Data Envelopment Analysis is a nonparametric algorithm for ranking the ability of decision making units 
(DMUs) to produce output given a set of inputs, i.e. the DMUs relative efficiencies.  Data Envelopment 
Analysis uses the methods of linear programming to assign each DMU an efficiency score between zero and 
one by solving the linear dual of the fractional optimization of a ratio of virtual outputs to virtual 
inputs. DEA uses variable weights to present each DMU in the best light possible to avoid biases caused 
by prior selection of weights.   It has been used to measure the efficiency of such varied classes of 
DMUs as hospitals, schools, banks, government services, and software programs.  In our paper we describe 
our implementation of DEA in Matlab and explore the effectiveness of using DEA efficiency scores to pick 
a stock portfolio, based on prior work by Abad, Thore, and Laffarga.

	Investing in international portfolios comes with the added risk of foreign currency exposure.  
The goal of our project is to examine various hedging strategies used to eliminate or reduce this 
risk over portfolios of multiple asset types.  Specifically we will look at the costs and returns 
to portfolios which use fixed versus variable interval rebalancing, as well as different target 
hedge ratios.  Using MATLAB, we build an engine to construct such portfolios and study the effects 
of different strategies.  
Ultimately this will help to devise an optimal approach to hedging currency exchange risk.

Work zones exacerbate delays on already-congested roadways by reducing the capacity.  
In order to minimize such delays, traffic engineers must strategically plan and schedule 
work zones.  The goal of our project is to help the Massachusetts Highway Department better 
model the effects of long-term work zones on traffic flow.  Specifically we consider queuing 
analysis, continuum models, various capacity calculations, with  Massachusetts-specific data 
in an effort to improve the accuracy of their model.

Microwave sintering of powders is gaining attention in the 
interdisciplinary engineering community as an innovative promising
technology of production of new nano-structured materials with unique
physical properties. Internally dissipated microwave power allows for energy
savings and fast processing of metallic, ceramic, and composite particulate
materials, but the process is practically uncontrolled and is poorly
understood. Modeling of microwave sintering could help clarify many issues
and suggest engineering solutions for designing efficient
microwave system. 

This project is focused on the development of a particular
element of a numerical tool for comprehensive simulation of electromagnetic,
thermal, and mechanical phenomena occuring during microwave sintering.
Combination of the relevant solvers requires interchange of numerical data
between the grids associated with the
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique and the finite element method
(FEM). Two techniques interfacing the FDTD mesh of Cartesian cells and the
FEM mesh of rectangular hexahedra are developed in this work. The algorithms
are built on cubic spline interpolation and the Shamos technique for
determination of areas of convex polyhedra. Computational experiments with
these algorithms implemented in MATLAB
show satisfactory accuracy of interfacing with the average error not more
than 5%.
